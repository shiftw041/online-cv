      - title: Innovative Entrepreneurship Training Project — Predicting Chip Packaging Test Termination Based on Diffusion Model
        time: March 2023 - December 2023
      #  company: Startup Hubs, San Francisco
        details: |
          Investigated the application of diffusion model algorithms in the EDA chip domain, improving fault diagnosis efficiency and quality by transforming test feedback into images.Designed machine learning algorithms combined with dynamic test termination prediction, using the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model to expand the image dataset for training.
            - Achieved higher accuracy and nearly 90% cost savings in test cost with the new scheme compared to the original one.
            - Team contributed the paper "Translating Test Responses to Images for Test-termination Prediction via Multiple Machine Learning Strategies," submitted to ACM-TODEAS (CCF-B).
      - title: HUST & USYD Summer School — Parallel Programming Practice
        time: July 2023 - August 2023
        details: |
          Learned basic parallel programming methods and implemented performance optimization for shared and distributed memory parallel computing systems using OpenMP or MPI interfaces, and CUDA programming optimization for GPU design.
      - title: On-Campus Research — Federated Learning for Medical Image Segmentation
        time: December 2023 - Present
        details: |
          Researched the application of federated learning in medical image segmentation, addressing issues of complex model structure and high computational cost.
            - Explored and integrated Quantization Aware Training (QAT) for model compression and inference acceleration, reducing computational load to approximately one-fourth of the floating-point precision with minimal loss of accuracy.
            - The team is currently writing a paper expected to be submitted to IEEE-BIBM (CCF-B).
      - title: Information Security Competition — Multimodal Audio Attack Detection Based on Neural Networks
        time: March 2024 - Present
        details: |
          Designed and implemented an intelligent detection system for multimodal audio attacks in voice recognition systems, showing good performance in detecting synthetic, replay, and adversarial attacks.
            - Developed an efficient voiceprint feature extraction and analysis system based on the residual network, integrating the Res2Net with the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) module.Achieved high accuracy and generalization in detecting synthetic and replay attacks with an EER of less than 1% using the international ASVSpoof dataset.
            - Employed a generative adversarial network to construct a neural vocoder to rebuild voice waveforms, identifying adversarial samples with unknown attack methods, with an AUC of 99% on the VoxCeleb open-source dataset.
